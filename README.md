# üõçÔ∏è Improve E-commerce Seller Operations with AI

Welcome to the **E-commerce Seller Operations AI Platform** project. This platform leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to enhance and optimize seller operations in e-commerce.

## üìÑ Project Description

This project involves the development of an AI platform that utilizes generative AI and Langchain to streamline and improve various aspects of e-commerce seller operations. By integrating multiple technologies such as OpenAI, Selenium, Playwright, OpenCV, Docker, and Python, the platform provides comprehensive solutions for e-commerce sellers.

### üîç How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user adds the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) of their product to our tool.
2. **Listing Analysis**: The platform checks the product listing to ensure all details (title, description, images) are filled properly according to Amazon guidelines.
3. **Scoring**: The platform evaluates the listing and assigns a score based on compliance with Amazon's guidelines.
4. **Recommendations**: The user receives recommendations on how to improve the listing to increase visibility and revenue.
